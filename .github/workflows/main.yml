    # mdBook does not currently have particularly good support for “external”
    # crates. To make the test suite work correctly with `trpl`, we must first
    # build `trpl` itself (`mdbook` will not do it), and then explicitly pass
    # its `deps` path as a library search path for `mdbook test`. That will make
    # sure all the crates can be resolved when running the tests.
